   <h1>What is task-chrono?</h1>
   <p><b>task-chrono</b> is a tool that helps in task planning. It does this by
   providing statistics on how accurately you estimate task duration. This will
   give insight in how good you are at estimating task duration, which in turn
   will help planning your work.</p>
   
   <p>The applicaton menu shows the following options:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><i>List:</i> the list of the tasks in your current list</li>
    <li><i>Stats:</i> estimation statistics</li>
    <li><i>Settings:</i> configure the application behaviour and manage lists</li>
    <li><i>Help:</i> this page</li>
    <li><i>Log out:</i> log out from the application</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h1>Task list</h1>
   <p>The task list shows all the tasks in the current list, sorted by date and
   status. Tasks in progress are on top, followed by newly created tasks, and
   finally finished tasks at the bottom. In all three categories, the oldest
   tasks is on top.</p>
    
    <h2>Adding a new task</h2>
    <p>To add a new task to the list, simply type a task name in the left field
    at the top of the page. In the second field, enter an estimate of how long
    you think it will take to complete the task (see hereafter). Click on the
    <i>Create</i> button to add the task to the list.</p>
     
     <h3>Estimated duration</h3>
     <p>Entering an estimate for task duration, use the following format:</p>
     <pre>NNd NNh NNs</pre>
     <p>Here, <i>NN</i> is any number, and <i>d</i> denotes work days, <i>h</i>
     denotes hours, and <i>m</i> minutes. The order of the groups is not
     important, nor are all mandatory: one is enough. As an example, the
     following all signify a duration of 9 hours and 30 minutes (assuming that
     one work day is set to be 8 hours; see below):</p>
     <pre>
     1d 1h 30m
     9h 30m
     1.125d 0.5h
     1.1875d
     9.5h
     570m
     </pre>
    
    <h2>Starting and stopping a task</h2>
    <p>Starting, stopping, an restarting a task is done by simply clicking on
    task name in the list. Active running tasks are highlighted in green, with
    the duration being updated in real time. Finished tasks are shown in a light
    grey, but can be restarted by again clicking on the task name. New tasks can
    be recognized by having no duration logged.</p>
    
    <h2>Task properties</h2>
    <p>By clicking on the line below the task name, the task properties are
    reveiled. These properties are the creation date and time, the moment it was
    first started, the moment it was last started, and the moment it was
    finished.
    
    <h2>Deleting a task</h2>
    <p>Below the tasks properties a button is shown to delete the task from the
    list. Removing a large number of old tasks can be done via the settings
    page.</p>
